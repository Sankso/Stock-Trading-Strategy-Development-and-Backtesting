Developed a comprehensive stock trading
strategy using Python, implementing technical indicators such as 
Average Directional Index (ADX),
Bollinger Bands, 
and Relative Strength Index (RSI). 

Conducted backtesting to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the strategy across various timeframes, analyzing buy and sell signals, cumulative returns,
annualized return, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio.

Utilized libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for
data manipulation and analysis, and fetched stock market data using the Alpha Vantage API to ensure
real-time analysis. It backtests the strategy using Appleâ€™s stock price data. It explains the methodology,
backtesting results, key performance metrics like cumulative and annual returns, and suggests potential
improvements, such as optimizing the ADX period and implementing risk management techniques.
